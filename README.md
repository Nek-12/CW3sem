Topic: "CLI application for tracking self-development progress"  

## Usage  
The app is only for linux.  
The coursework is now almost archived.  
This CW is an example of the cleanest code I'm able to write so far. It doesn't contain sophisticated algorithms or a
lot of features but rather shows how the project should be structured and what features of C++ 20 I'm able to use.
